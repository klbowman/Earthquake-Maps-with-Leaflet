# Earthquake Data Visualizations with Leaflet 

Interactive maps that visualize global earthquake data. View the final product [here](https://klbowman.github.io/leaflet-challenge/).

## Description

This repository uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to create two interactive maps of earthquake occurrences across the globe, using GeoJSON data from the [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). The first map shows the location of all earthquakes recorded during the past 30 days on an OpenStreetMap tile layer. Data marker size corresponds to earthquake magnitude and color corresponds to the depth where the earthquake began to rupture. Data marker popups include a description of the earthquake location, date and time of occurrence, magnitude, and depth (kilometers). 

**Earthquake Map 1:**

The second map shows the location of all earthquakes recorded during the past 30 days, and the location of tectonic plate boundaries, with three tile layer options. Earthquake data markers and popup information is the same as the first map. Layer control is used to toggle between three map layers (Satellite, Grayscale, Outdoors) and two datasets (Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes).

**Earthquake Map 2:**
